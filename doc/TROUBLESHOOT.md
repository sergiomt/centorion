# Troubleshooting

In case you have made any change to Vagrantfile then validate it with:

	`vagrant validate`

In case you need a full debug trace during VM creation you may use:

	`vagrant up machine_name -- debug > vagrant_debug.log 2>&1`

For watching your SSH configuration use:

	`vagrant ssh-config`

For trying to stablish an SSH connection with debug enabled use:

	`vagrant ssh -- -vvv`

At Vagrantfile, set `vb.gui = true` enable the GUI of VirtualBox and see whether the VM is waiting for input on startup
